## Author's comments regarding version 
Current version: 1.0
- Stand-alone HTML (to easily share for mobile use): Bridge_IMP_Calculator_Full_1.0.html
- Package HTML+CSS+JS: Bridge_IMP_Calculator.html + bridgeCalc.js + style.css


My to do list:
- to make sure it works well on mobile...
- to add clearer refresh option (possibly new button & function)
- to clean language mess & add language toggle (PL/EN)
- to make it prettier (CSS)
- to improve usage description
- to add link to the page "How it is calculated" (creating the calculation tutorial)
- to correct comments for better readability


## Author's comments regarding usage
Calculator to be used to calculate IMP points for a single playing table (instead of comparing scores of two tables, we compare to "value expected by our hand ponits".
(V.1.0) Currently app is partially in Polish, partially English, it will be fixed later for consistency. Language doesn't matter for calculations, as long as you know that "No double" = "Bez kontry", "Double" - "Z kontrą", "Redouble" - "Z rekontrą", "Invulverable" - "Przed partią", "Vulverable" - "Po partii".
